## prudentprogrammer.github.io - My Personal Website
### (Still in progress)
This is the repo for my personal website. I am so glad Github gives you a personal github page (Thanks git <3). The website uses plain old HTML, CSS, and JS/JQuery.
At the moment, it should be mentioned that the entire website was authored by hand, instead of using a MVC framework. I wanted to create a personal website as quickly as possible and therefore I chose to use the *Materialize CSS Framework*. This framework provides elegant design and responsive features and I'm thoroughly impressed with the framework.
