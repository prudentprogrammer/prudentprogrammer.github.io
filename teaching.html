            <p class="flow-text">&emsp;My teaching experience goes back to high school where I was a teacher assistant for my Introduction to Programming class. I can never forget the amount of joy and satisfaction I had TA'ing for that class. Mr.Shelby, who was my teacher at that time, would often encourage me to go around the classroom and help other people who were stuck. In all seriousness, simple actions such as giving students hints, encouraging new approaches, and sharing my meager knowledge (at that time) gave rise to new ideas and feelings in my life.
            <br />
              &emsp;Later, when I started my undergraduate career, I became a part of the Tutoring Committee for the Computer Science Club. The committee's main goal was helping out undergraduate students with their coursework and conducting review sessions for the students to enforce and master the concepts they learned in their classes. Even though I did not participate in review sessions, I was an active member from Dec 2013 to Dec 2014 and helped the students with their homework assignments and understanding important concepts. Doing so was also a great experience since it improved my communication skills, increased connections, and provided me with a feeling of confidence and upliftment. There's nothing more satisfying than when a student gets that "Ahaha" moment and you help him/her achieve it.

              &emsp;As of now, I am a graduate student who is actively looking for oppurtunities to become a teacher assistant for an undergraduate <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> class, not because of some absurb financial or social status. No. Not because my friends will revere me if I am a TA or start treating me in a respectable way. None of these matter. I want to do it because of the pure joy of teaching and sharing knowledge. I strongly believe that giving something to the society increases the quality of your life. In this case, it is giving knowledge. <br />
              &emsp;It is also by this principle that I have taken the Pragmatic Programming Chair position of the Davis Computer Science Club. The responsibilities of this position includes teaching students topics outside of school and informing them about new ideas, technologies, and concepts. <a href="http://daviscsclub.org/committee/pragprog" target="_blank">Click this link to learn more about <abbr title="Pragmatic Programming Committee">PragProg</abbr>.</a>
